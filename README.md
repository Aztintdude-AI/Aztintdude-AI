# 👋 Hi, I’m @Aztintdude-AI

- 👀 I’m interested in automotive customization — especially **window tinting**, **paint protection film (PPF)**, and **emergency signaling innovations**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build **digital training courses**, run an **e-commerce business**, and develop **solar-powered safety devices** like my S.O.S. (Solar Observation Signal).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Automotive training programs (tint & PPF)
  - Product design & prototyping
  - Online education tools for the auto industry
- 📫 How to reach me: aztintdude@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been tinting windows for over 30 years, love riding dirt bikes, catching sunsets, and creating things that help people stay safe.
